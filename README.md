# BookVerse-OnlineBookstore
The Online Bookstore Project is a web application built with Spring Boot that replicates the core features of a modern online bookstore while demonstrating full-stack Java development skills. It allows users to browse, search, and purchase books, and provides administrators with tools to manage books, users, orders, and blogs through a secure dashboard. The project combines Spring Boot, Spring MVC, and Spring Data JPA (Hibernate) for backend logic and database management, using MySQL for data storage. On the frontend, Thymeleaf, HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript create a responsive and user-friendly interface. Following the MVC architecture, the system ensures scalability, modularity, and maintainability. It also implements authentication, validation, and session management for secure interactions. Designed as a practical learning project, the Online Bookstore bridges theoretical Java knowledge with real-world development, offering hands-on experience in building, deploying, and managing a complete Spring Boot-based web application.
